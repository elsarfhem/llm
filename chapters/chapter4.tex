\chapter{Capabilities of Large Language Models}
\label{ch:capabilities}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:ch3-introduction}

In this chapter, we will discuss the capabilities of large language models, focusing on the abilities that they have been designed to have and the ones that they have been shown to have in practice.
We will start by discussing the basic abilities that large language models have, such as language generation, knowledge utilization, and complex reasoning.
We will then move on to more advanced abilities, such as human alignment and interaction with external tools.
